In today’s digital era, data is being generated at an unprecedented rate — from social media activity and streaming platforms to IoT sensors and enterprise applications. According to the International Data Corporation (IDC), global data creation is projected to exceed 175 zettabytes by 2025. This explosive growth brings significant challenges in terms of data storage, network bandwidth, and efficient transmission.

To address these challenges, lossless data compression has become a critical research and development area. By reducing file sizes without losing any information, compression techniques help optimize storage resources and accelerate data transfer, especially in bandwidth-constrained environments. Reports from IEEE, ACM, and ResearchGate consistently highlight the importance of lossless compression in modern computing, cloud systems, multimedia applications, and communication networks.

This project focuses on developing and implementing efficient, lossless data compression algorithms that enable:

Reduced storage requirements

Faster and more reliable data transmission

Optimized use of bandwidth and system resources

Sustainable and scalable data management practices

The goal is to contribute toward a more efficient digital ecosystem by designing compression solutions that keep pace with growing data demands.
